# Wooden Fish Knock Knock (Vue Ver.)

### Description

A small project for me to try something new (pnpm, Tailwind, Howler.js, GSAP, GitHub Actions, etc.).
You can knock on wooden fish (or replace to your boss's head!) to calm yourself down.
There's a version of this project developed with React: [Wooden Fish Knock Knock (React Ver.)](https://github.com/unicornGL/wooden-fish-knock-knock-react-ver)
